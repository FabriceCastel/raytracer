Fab's Raytracer
===============

Objectives:

1. Texture mapping
2. Volumetric lighting
3. Height mapping
4. Depth of field
5. ~~Refraction~~
6. Blinn-Phong lighting (to replace current Phong model)
7. Generate animation frames based off MIDI input
8. Particle system
9. Taurus primitive
10. Non-taurus 4th degree implicit surface primitive with genus > 1

A ray tracer written for CS488, to be extended as a final project due Dec 1st 2014, I'm keeping progress logs below:

I've added refraction to the sphere objects; the raytracer can now emulate glass-like surfaces.
